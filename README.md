# Cartesian-product
To find Cartesian Product relations in FB15k and perform link prediction on these relations:
```
python fb15k_cartesian_product.py
```

# FB15k-redundancy
To find the reverse and duplicate relations in FB15k:
```
python FB15k_redundancy.py
```
To find redundant information in test set of FB15k:
```
python FB15k_test_redundancy.py
```

# AMIE
Implementations for conducting link prediction using rules generated by AMIE.
## Run the experiments
Head and tail entity link prediction for a specific test relation:

```
python left.py relation_id
python right.py relation_id
```
Results obtained for each test relation are stored in ./AMIE_LinkPrediction_results. 

To have Hits@10 and Hits@1 results of link prediction using AMIE:
```
python combine_res.py
```

To obtain the detailed results and charts:

```
python detailed_results.py
```

# Models-detailed-results
To obtain the link prediction results for each test relation of FB15k-237:
```
python result_by_rel_all.py
```

To calculate the head and tail entity link prediction results for different relation types:
```
python result_by_relcategory.py
```

Percentage of triples on which each method outperforms others, separately for each relation:

```
python heatmap.py
```

Percentage of test triples with better performance than TransE that have reverse and duplicate triples in training set:

```
python reverse_percentage.py
```
